# Guessing Game

This is a simple guessing game written in Python. The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number. The player has 10 tries to guess the number.

## How to play

To play the game, simply run the `guessing_game.py` file. The game will then generate a random number between 1 and 100. You will then have 10 tries to guess the number. After each guess, the game will tell you whether your guess was too high or too low.

If you guess the number correctly, the game will print a message congratulating you and telling you how many tries it took you to guess the number. If you do not guess the number correctly within 10 tries, the game will print a message telling you that you have lost.

## Code

The code for the guessing game is relatively simple. The main function first generates a random number between 1 and 100. It then starts a loop that allows the player to guess the number. The loop continues until the player either guesses the number correctly or runs out of tries.

After each guess, the game checks to see if the player's guess is correct. If the guess is correct, the game prints a message congratulating the player and telling them how many tries it took them to guess the number. If the guess is not correct, the game prints a message telling the player whether their guess was too high or too low.

The game also keeps track of the number of tries the player has left. If the player runs out of tries, the game prints a message telling them that they have lost.

## Conclusion

This is a simple guessing game written in Python. The game is easy to play and can be used to teach children about programming. The code is also relatively simple, making it a good starting point for learning how to write Python programs.
